      <h4>  This has been weird. In a community and business where "The Show Must Go On", there is a indefinite period of darkness. There were 16 more commercial shows set to open this spring ahead of awards season, and a slew of Off-Broadway shows beginning- now halted. I'm scared for the industry and this living artform once this pandemic slowly ends. I'm hoping to be able to be back in the theater this year, but who knows at this point. <br> And, when it returns what will it be like?</h4>
