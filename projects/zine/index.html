 			<h3> Where did the idea of Arthur come from? </h3>
 			<h2> It was a bedtime story that I told my son Tolin on a very bad day. I had just lost my teaching job in Boston and came home that night and  just wanted to collapse and he said “tell me a bedtime story” and I was really coming up empty so I asked “so what should I tell you a story about?” and he said “tell me a story about a weird animal” and so I guess I kind of starting thinking alphabetically and aardvark came to mind. So then he wanted to know his name and then he asked me to draw him a picture, and I thought this is so much fun, why can’t I do this for a job? And at the time I was sort of doing freelance work for textbook companies in Boston and one of my editors there said “you should really see this editor at the Atlantic Monthly Press she likes to discover new authors and her name is Emily Macleod”.

 			I got an appointment with her and I was kind of terrified. I remember putting my portfolio together from art school and I took it in and she looked through it and she said “Ah, you have to let go of all this and forget all this technique you learned” and I thought, “What?! I spent all these years in art school learning this technique!” and she said “concentrate on the characters and their emotions and their expressions” because I took this little story I had, this little bedtime story about an aardvark to her and she said “it needed a lot of work” and she was so right because what I was doing was using two paragraphs to do what maybe one good sentence in a picture book could do. Because I came to understand that when you write a picture book, its its like balancing a scales you have the pictures on one side words on the other side and you’re constantly trying to bring them together and you want to come up with the most efficient way possible to uh tell your story and use your pictures to do what the words can’t do and the words should be doing what the pictures can’t do. So that was a really good lesson, and after about six months of revision she said “I think we may have a book here” and uh I cannot look at that first book “About Arthur” because it’s to me so raw it’s like going to a party in my underwear. Because it looks to me unfinished but it was a great learning experience. </h2>
